# K_Means_clustering
K-means clustering is one of the most widely used unsupervised machine learning algorithms that forms clusters of data based on the similarity between data instances. For this particular algorithm to work, the number of clusters has to be defined beforehand. The K in the K-means refers to the number of clusters.

The K-means algorithm starts by randomly choosing a centroid value for each cluster. After that the algorithm iteratively performs three steps:

(i) Find the Euclidean distance between each data instance and centroids of all the clusters.

(ii) Assign the data instances to the cluster of the centroid with nearest distance.

(iii) Calculate new centroid values based on the mean values of the coordinates of all the data instances from the corresponding cluster.
